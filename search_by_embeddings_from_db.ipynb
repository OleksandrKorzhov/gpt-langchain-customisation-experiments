Writing a small service that relies on other dependent services requires a different approach than a writing a traditional monolithic or layered application.

Network congestion and latency. The use of many small, granular services can result in more interservice communication. Also, if the chain of service dependencies gets too long (service A calls B, which calls C...), the additional latency can become a problem. You will need to design APIs carefully.

You can update a service without redeploying the entire application, and roll back an update if something goes wrong. In many traditional applications, if a bug is found in one part of the application, it can block the entire release process. New features might be held up waiting for a bug fix to be integrated, tested, and published. Small, focused teams. A microservice should be small enough that a single feature team can build, test, and deploy it. Small team sizes promote greater agility. Large teams tend be less productive, because communication is slower, management overhead goes up, and agility diminishes. Small code base. In a monolithic application, there is a tendency over time for code dependencies to become tangled. Adding a new feature requires touching code in a lot of places.

Teams can pick the technology that best fits their service, using a mix of technology stacks as appropriate. Fault isolation.

Internal implementation details of each service are hidden from other services. Supports polyglot programming. For example, services don't need to share the same technology stack, libraries, or frameworks.\", metadata={'source': './docs/preprocessed_with_gpt/what_is_microservice_architecture.txt'}),\n Document(page_content='Microservice Architecture Style - Components\\nBesides for the services themselves, some other components appear in a typical microservices architecture: Management/orchestration. This component is responsible for placing services on nodes, identifying failures, rebalancing services across nodes, and so forth. Typically this component is an off-the-shelf technology such as Kubernetes, rather than something custom built. API Gateway. The API gateway is the entry point for clients. Instead of calling services directly, clients call the API gateway, which forwards the call to the appropriate services on the back end. Advantages of using an API gateway include: It decouples clients from services. Services can be versioned or refactored without needing to update all of the clients. Services can use messaging protocols that are not web friendly, such as AMQP. The API Gateway can perform other cross-cutting functions such as authentication, logging, SSL termination, and load balancing. Out-of-the-box policies, like for throttling, caching, transformation, or validation.', metadata={'source': './docs/preprocessed_with_gpt/what_is_microservice_architecture.txt'})]"
