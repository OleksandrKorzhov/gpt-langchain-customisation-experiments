But I noticed people bemoaning the loss of Postum, and wanted to let you know that it has returned. The new company got the trademark and says it tastes the same. You can read about it at postum dot com\n",

      " - Title: Neither too sweet nor fizzy; Content: V8 V-Fusion may appear to be the typical energy drink that is available today, but the difference between V8 and drinks such as Red Bull, this drink contains vegetable and fruit and 50 calories.  This may be a nice alternative to carbonated sodas or sugary fruit juices because it contains nutritional ingredients that may provide a bit of energy for the day.  The drink contains fruity peach mango flavor, green tea, and vitamin B, but also a concentration of potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and carrots.<br /><br />With the natural energy that V8 V-Fusion provides, one may want to switch from the regular cup of coffee or fizzy pop that usually contains the energy for the day.  The taste is satisfying, not too sweet, fruity, acidic, or watery.  And after trying the 8 fl. Oz. Can, one may not be enough, however, the contents warn that it may not be recommended for children, women nursing or pregnant, or individuals watching their caffeine in take.  But one recommendation, chill the drink before serving.\n",
