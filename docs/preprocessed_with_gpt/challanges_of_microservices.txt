Challenges of Microservices - Complexity
A microservices application has more moving parts than the equivalent monolithic application. Each service is simpler, but the entire system as a whole is more complex.

Challenges of Microservices - Development and Testing
Writing a small service that relies on other dependent services requires a different approach than a writing a traditional monolithic or layered application. Existing tools are not always designed to work with service dependencies. Refactoring across service boundaries can be difficult. It is also challenging to test service dependencies, especially when the application is evolving quickly.

Challenges of Microservices - Lack of Governance
The decentralized approach to building microservices has advantages, but it can also lead to problems. You might end up with so many different languages and frameworks that the application becomes hard to maintain. It might be useful to put some project-wide standards in place, without overly restricting teams' flexibility. This especially applies to cross-cutting functionality such as logging.

Challenges of Microservices - Network Congestion and Latency
The use of many small, granular services can result in more interservice communication. Also, if the chain of service dependencies gets too long (service A calls B, which calls C...), the additional latency can become a problem. You will need to design APIs carefully. Avoid overly chatty APIs, think about serialization formats, and look for places to use asynchronous communication patterns like queue-based load leveling.

Challenges of Microservices - Data Integrity
With each microservice responsible for its own data persistence. As a result, data consistency can be a challenge. Embrace eventual consistency where possible.

Challenges of Microservices - Management
To be successful with microservices requires a mature DevOps culture. Correlated logging across services can be challenging. Typically, logging must correlate multiple service calls for a single user operation.

Challenges of Microservices - Versioning
Updates to a service must not break services that depend on it. Multiple services could be updated at any given time, so without careful design, you might have problems with backward or forward compatibility.

Challenges of Microservices - Skill Set
Microservices are highly distributed systems. Carefully evaluate whether the team has the skills and experience to be successful.
