      "    Input: Title: Good flavor, but a wet mess; Content: I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.\n",

This may be a nice alternative to carbonated sodas or sugary fruit juices because it contains nutritional ingredients that may provide a bit of energy for the day.  The drink contains fruity peach mango flavor, green tea, and vitamin B, but also a concentration of potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and carrots.<br /><br />With the natural energy that V8 V-Fusion provides, one may want to switch from the regular cup of coffee or fizzy pop that usually contains the energy for the day.  The taste is satisfying, not too sweet, fruity, acidic, or watery.  And after trying the 8 fl. Oz. Can, one may not be enough, however, the contents warn that it may not be recommended for children, women nursing or pregnant, or individuals watching their caffeine in take.

The taste, however, is TERRIFIC.  The cannister included a recipe for muffins made with the mix.  I tried them and they were TERRRIFIC.  I then went on to make a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies using the multigrain cereal instead of oats. They were TERRIFIC.  Moving right along through my recipe box I added some of the multigrain cereal to a pumpkin bread recipe.  Can you guess?  It was TERRIFIC.  Lasly, I may not enjoy eating this cereal solo, but I find using half steel cut oats and half multigrain cereal makes a TERRIFIC porridge.<br />In looking at others reviews I see that most people love this as a cereal.

      "    Input: Title: Love It!; Content: If you've never had a BCalm before, you've gotta try it.  It's really the perfect drink for relaxation.  Good for a stressful day in the office, a day at the beach, or pretty much anywhere you are.  As a commercial director, I'm on set all the time.  And while coffee is great early in the morning, there's really nothing better than a BCalm (or two) in the afternoon.  Keeps me going, while putting me at ease.  Definitely give it a shot!\n",

I've made and drank two batches of the tea ( each makes four 8-oz cups) and I assume all the health-giving properties are doing their thing!  The tea itself is bland and pretty tasteless.  I drink it icy cold and it's like drinking water - no better, no worse.  People can add sweetener and drink it hot or warm also, but I just drink it in place of one of my usual water beverages because that is what I prefer.  It's a health drink and I can't imagine anyone disliking it, and that's the main thing.  You don't have to hold your nose and choke it down.  It's fine.\n",

      "    Input: Title: Mung Beans for sprouting; Content: I wanted to feed my chickens, turkeys and goats just a little extra protein to keep them fit and healthy while the goats are pregnant over the winter and the chickens and turkeys are getting ready for breeding season.  Sprouts seemed like a good idea but everytime I tried to sprout regular beans they would go bad before the sprouts were big enough to interest the poultry.  So I saw that the ones I was eating out of can were grown from mung beans.  Never heard of them before but thought I'd give it a try.  The beans took longer to get here than I would have liked (almost two weeks) but that just tells me the time frame I need before I order more.  And the beans!!!!  Oh my goodness, you'll get 100% germination and sprouts that are easily eaten and really quite yummy in just three days.  I need to get a bigger growing apparatus so that I can make more at one time.  The chickens, turkeys, goats and even my pregnant cow LOVE the sprouts.  I've found the extra source of protein I needed.  Thanks so much.\n",

So I am constantly on the hunt for low sodium foods that are naturally that way. This is a perfect cure for my salty food cravings. I haven't tried the other flavors yet but I plan to.\n",

Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.  Everybody is happy, and the dogs get the required meds.\n",
